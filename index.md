Governance • Risk • Research • IT

I explore and build **Banking Supervisory Models (BSM)** — frameworks that connect governance, risk, and operational resilience.

Governance is system design.  
Systems create outcomes.  
Good systems reduce risk.  
Strong systems survive stress.

## Banking Supervisory Model (BSM)

A supervisory model with four components:

- **SO** — Bank Soundness Model
- **SU** — Bank Structuring Model
- **RC** — Recovery Plan
- **RS** — Resolution Plan

These components help institutions:

✔ measure soundness  
✔ structure governance  
✔ plan recovery  
✔ design resolution

## Research Notes

Research is exploration.

Questions > answers.  
Models > opinions.  
Evidence > assumption.

I treat governance as research:

- observe systems
- model behavior
- test assumptions
- refine understanding
